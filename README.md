# React-Soccer-App

## Description

This React application utilizes data from an Sportradar API to generate a result table of matches. The table's contents can be filtered by the season by selecting options from a select dropdown. Each row in the table represents a match, and clicking on a row will take the user to a timeline view of that specific match.
